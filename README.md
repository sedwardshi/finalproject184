windpower plant and the GDP
### abstract
Green energy is a key innovation that discovered in the recent years. It will essentially replace the fossil fuel and take a important role in the global energy market. Not only it will reduce the CO2 emission, the green energy can also be created by non- physical matters such as sun light or wind. Wind power is a special energy resource that based on the electricity generation from the wind power plant. It requires strict geographical features to build and electricity generation is hard to examine before implementation. Based on 2018 data resource, United States of America currently has 430 wind power plant that operate. 

### Guiding question 
1. What is the shape of the distribution of wind power plant looks like? 
2. Does the number of wind power plant affect the GDP in the local state?
3. If possible, predict new location of the wind power plant constructionï¼Ÿ

### data resource
The table comes from the website https://openei.org/datasets/dataset/miller-keith-2018-windplantdata/resource/3bf6f992-69fc-4ff1-a07f-8f9b97f97571
and the data source comes from openei.org.
The data has been collected two scholars Miller and Keith (2018, Environ. Res. Lett. 13 104008), collected in 2018.

The gdp by state is generated from the dataset from the bea.gov website. The full data table contain the gdp by quarters in 2018, comparing with the data in 2017. The data has been collected by the governmental official.
